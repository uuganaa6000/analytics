FXGraphics2D
============

Version 1.6, 5 November 2017.

Overview
--------
**FXGraphics2D** is a free implementation of Java's `Graphics2D` API that targets the JavaFX Canvas.  It makes it possible to reuse existing Java2D code in a JavaFX application. 

![FXGraphics2D sample](http://www.object-refinery.com/blog/images/fxgraphics2d_normalised.png)

 The code has been developed for the use of **Orson Charts** (http://www.object-refinery.com/orsoncharts/) 
and **JFreeChart** (http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart).  Numerous demos can be
found in the [JFree-FXDemos](https://github.com/jfree/jfree-fxdemos "JFree-FXDemos Project Page at GitHub")
project page at GitHub.

You can also read about *FXGraphics2D* in this Java Magazine article:

Implementation Notes
--------------------
(1) Initial versions of the JavaFX Canvas did not have support for dashed lines.  We submitted this feature request:

    https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8097787

The feature was added in Java 1.8.0_40.

(2) In performance testing we have noted that path rendering is not as fast as it could be.  This is confirmed by this bug report:

    https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8092373

History
-------

##### 5-Nov-2017 : Version 1.6
- added support for JDK9 by removing the use of some non-public classes;
- simplified the project set-up by removing Ant as a build option, and removing the demos (these will be provided in a separate Git project https://github.com/jfree/jfree-fxdemos).

##### 15-Oct-2016 : Version 1.5
- add rendering hint to provide option for measuring fonts via JavaFX API;
- fix exception in `drawImage()` method with `null` transform;
- updated JFreeSVG to version 3.2 (affects demo only).

##### 27-Apr-2016 : Version 1.4
- improve handling of `setComposite()` for alpha values;
- fixed bug in rotate method, incorrect conversion to degrees.

##### 28-Jan-2016 : Version 1.3
- fixed bug in `drawImage()` method;
- add 'maven' directory with a pom that can be copied over to load the project
  in NetBeans;
- updated Ant script to copy over `pom.xml` to distribution.

#####Â 23-Jan-2016 : Version 1.2.1 
- implemented `getGraphicsDevice()` method;
- add support for dashed lines;
- in `setPaint()` and `setStroke()`, don't update anything if the value is the same;
- various performance fixes;
- fixed bug in `drawImage()` method;
- updated demos.

Note that version 1.2.1 corrects a Maven dependency problem that sneaked into the 1.2 release.

##### 30-Jul-2014 : Version 1.1
- fix clipping so that combined plots in JFreeChart work correctly;
- observe `KEY_STROKE_CONTROL` rendering hint for lines and rectangles (used to 
  sharpen gridlines and borders in JFreeChart);
- adjust `fontRenderContext` so that glyph positioning is more precise for 
  `TextLayout`;
- add `clearRect()` call in the JFreeChart demo;
- add Maven support (pom.xml).

##### 19-May-2014 : Version 1.0
